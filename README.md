These are the raw files to be used

* Data Cleaning

1. Check for Null values, duplicates and indentify the outliers
2. Properly specify the data types of the respective columns
3. Identify the columns which are to this task and remove the unwanted ones
  
* Data Modelling

  Prepare a single excel workbook by combining the releavant columns from the cleaned data using "VLookUP" formula

* EDA

  At this step you can perform the actual analysis on the modelled dataset using statustics and Excel formulae like "AVERAGE" , "SUM", "COUNT" and their corresponding condition versions like "AVERAGEIF"
  Some of the insights I found out are :
  1. Top 5 performing content categories
  2. Month wise distribution of content consumption
  3. Sentiment Distribution
  4. Few Categories performing performing the least
  5. Year wise distribution of content consumption
  

* Visualization

  There are no expetations for Data Visualizations as such in this program but I went ahead to do in oder to express insights in more exciting way. I used Power BI to design an interactive dashboard
